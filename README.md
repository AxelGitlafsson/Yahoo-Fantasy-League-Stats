# Yahoo-Fantasy-League-Stats
Script designed to help fantasy sports enthusiasts pull and analyze team and player stats for their Head to Head Yahoo NBA fantasy league based off 2025 player projections.

Projections pulled from the "Starting Rosters" section of a Yahoo NBA Fantasy League, then merged with 2025 player projections from hashtagbasketball.com.

Team stats are evaluated using Z scores (standard deviations from the mean) for each category for each player. The script creates an excel file with a sheet for each team containing their player's stats and zscores (along with a few other things). It also creates a sheet summarizing each team's rating for each category.
